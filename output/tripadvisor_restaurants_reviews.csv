0	0	Good start, tapered off a bit	Recensito ieri 	4	Data della visita:  luglio 2023	0	Everything started off pretty interesting, great palate cleansers and starters. Our first 'proper' starter was ok, more interesting than delicious, kind of bitter, but ok. A few great courses after that, then a very disappointing main course. Apart from some greens and some grains, it was basically just beef and a VERY stingy amount of sauce. There was a big spiel about it, but it didn't feel any more special than a main course I'd had at a 1 star, just less sauce, and served almost room temp. The desserts weren't bad, but for the climatic end to a very expensive 3 star meal, strawberries and cream felt a bit normal. And as far as the flavours and textures, not mind blowing. Definitely some impressive techniques, but as a whole it didn't eat much different to desserts I had made at home myself. Overall it was a cool experience, but this was our first time at anything above a 1 star restaurant, and it didn't blow us away like we hoped it would.

The staff, the greeting and each course, the night was seamless and sped past but the memories of the sheer genius of Heston will live on for a very long time. Three couples traveled from Sydney and based a holiday around this visit, so much anticipation was indeed given. Not once dis we doubt that this was an experience, indeed a Sensorium of adventure, fun & discovery.

2	0	Wow - A Food Theatre 	Recensito 1 settimana fa 	116	Data della visita:  luglio 2023	0	We went for sensorium for our wedding anniversary as a very, very special treat. Yes it's expensive, yes I would pay and go again without hesitation. There are blank walls, no music to interfere with the experience. Everything is controlled for pleasure. When we went to the toilet our serviettes were refolded and placed tidily. My wife sneezed and a waitress came with a box of tissues. You must have seen Heston on TV, the food is exactly what you would expect, top quality and amazing experience. The Full environment is controlled with color changing.l lights above your head to control the ambience. This is astounding. Thank you to the 15 story tellers delivering food and the 43 chefs spread across Bray 	True	--	--	--	--	1	andykitch	Recensore livello  6  	Utente di Tripadvisor da ago 2013	Uomo da Selby, Regno Unito	108 contributi	45 voti utili	68 città visitate	15 foto	Amante della natura, Ecoturista, Viaggiatore di lusso	 64	 19	 7	 6	 13

5	0	Nothing short of spectacular!	Recensito 2 settimane fa 	10	Data della visita:  giugno 2023	0	What can we say, our visit to The Fat Duck was nothing less than spectacular! It has been around 15 years since we last visited this amazing restaurant. However our dining experience this time was again was second to none. Tom and his staff made us feel that the dishes that we were being presented were the first time they had ever been described to the diner. The enthusiasm and passion that went into the presentation of the quite beautiful dishes certainly showed how proud the team were of their hard work. The whole evening was flawless; so to say it was a “well-oiled machine” really doesn’t do the restaurant justice. However one thing I won’t do in this review is to describe each of the dishes or even say how many courses there were as this will spoil the surprise for anyone who has booked, but not yet had the pleasure of The Fat Duck experience! We also enjoyed a couple of unexpected extras, but again I won't give the details and spoil someone else's fun!   We have recently dined at another 3* restaurant, however The Fat Duck just does something that I don’t believe you can experience in any other restaurant. Is it expensive; Yes!, Is it worth it; Most definitely Yes!   We will certainly be retuning and it will not be another 15 years before we do so!

6	0	Mind Boggling	Recensito 2 settimane fa 	43	Data della visita:  giugno 2023	0	Absolutely sensational.!!! Apprehensive about going as I didn’t want to find too much out before hand. But rest assured that if you’re in the same situation as I was it was one of the best experiences I’ve ever had.  Knocked on the road side front door and invited in and shown to our table. The staff ALL attentive, welcoming and could not do enough to make sure the comfort of the visit.  Now for the food…  Every one of the 11/12 courses are perfectly done. Wide range of textures, tastes and feelings eating them cooked and presented perfectly. Lobster, beef, vegetables, herbs and cheese no fault!! ( don’t want to go into too much details as not to spoil it for others ) all from humble ingredients nothing OTT and just making it taste amazing!  Wouldn’t ever hesitate to tell anyone thinking of going TO GO!!!! I’ve seen reviews saying it’s more about the experience over the food but for me/us the experience AND food was just about perfect. Will most definitely be back!  Thanks to the whole of the fat duck team for a great Saturday lunch!!

9	0	The fat duck - von wegen fett!!!	Recensito 4 settimane fa 	474	Data della visita:  settembre 2022	0	Nun ich habe ich es doch nach Bray im Bezirk Windsor in der Nähe von London ins Heston Blumenthal`s “The Fat Duck” geschafft. Über Jahre sprachen wir dort über das beste Restaurant Großbritanniens und über mehrere Jahre konnte man sich auch in der San Pellegrino Liste Podiumsplätze sichern. Aktuell wird im Restaurant das 25 jährige Jubiläum gefeiert und von daher werden in gewissen Monatsabständen Menüs serviert, welche die besten Gänge des Restaurants der vergangene Jahre beinhalten sollen. Aktuell wird das 5. Chapter in der Küche zubereitet.  Das Restaurant ist von aussen recht unscheinbar und erinnert eher an eine Dorfkneipe, als an ein 3 Sterne Haus in der Nähe von London. Auch von innen kann man keinen Style oder Schick erkennen. Es gibt tiefe Decken und viel Holz, was es zumindest etwas gemütlich macht. Ein Blick in die Weinliste offenbart sofort, dass man sich nicht in einer Dorfkneipe befindet, sondern man könnte annehmen in einem Rooftop Restaurant mit 3 Sternen in Tokio oder Paris zu sein. Der Faktor ist teilweise mit 6 mal so viel wie der ursprüngliche Einkaufspreis gewählt, was selbst in dieser Kategorie als Abzocke bezeichnet werden kann. Ich entscheide mich für einen Complantée Extra Brut Champagner aus dem Hause Pascal Agrapart. Die Assemblage weißt 5 Gramm Dosage auf und ist für meinen Geschmack einen Tick zu süß als Menübegleitung, aber sei’s drum. Ein Blick in die Menükarte offenbart 12 Gänge zu 275 Pfund, was umgerechnet etwa 315 Euro sind. Für den aufgerufenen Preis sollte zumindest einiges an Produkten verbaut sein, was diesen Preis rechtfertigt. Jetzt lehne ich mich aber zuerst einmal zurück und erwarte die ersten Grüße aus der Küche. Bei der Erwartungshaltung soll es allerdings bleiben, denn ohne Umschweife startet man ins Menü mit einem geeisten Nitro Aperitif. Dazu wird ein Schaum von Gin&Tonic in Stickstoff verfestigt, den man anschließend in one bite verspeisen darf. Das ist sicherlich sehr innovativ und auch ein netter Starter als Aperitif, aber als einen „Gang“ sollte man diesen Bite nicht bezeichnen. Es geht weiter mit der Roten Beete mit Rettichfüllung. Hierzu wird eine kleine Kugel, welche tatsächlich noch kleiner als ein Macarons ist, serviert. Auch hier ist der Bite gut gemacht, aber auf Grund seiner Größe, oder besser nicht vorhandenen Größe, viel zu schnell aus dem Mund verschwunden und kann somit getrost auch nicht als Gang bezeichnet werden.  Es geht weiter mit den „Tonic of Botanicals“, einem Gurkenwasser. Dieser „Gang“ ist der erste des Abends, welcher in Größe halbwegs an einen normalen Teller heran kommt. Halbwegs deshalb, weil er in jedem anderen Sterne-Restaurant als Amuse Bouche serviert werden würde. Der Gang ist schön angerichtet und transportiert viel Frische zum Gaumen, welcher hierzu gut vorbereitet wird auf das nun endlich startende „richtige“ Menü.  Pustekuchen; zuerst wird Brioche mit aufgeschlagener Butter und einer Marmelade auf Tomaten-Kaffee Basis serviert. Ohne Zweifel ist das lecker; hat aber nichts mit Fine Dining oder einem 3 Sterne Haus zu tun. Mein Bäcker um die Ecke bekommt dies genau so gut hin und so bin ich langsam etwas ratlos.  Meine Ratlosigkeit soll sich auch im nächsten Gang fortsetzen, denn nun wird das „Breakfast in a Bowl“ serviert. Bei der Bowl handelt es sich eher um ein kleines Schälchen, in dem eine weiße Creme mit ein paar Splittern Trüffel in homöopathischer Dosis liegt. Dazu gibt es kleine Schachteln, wie man sie als Kind kannte, in denen Cornflakes serviert wurden. In der fetten Ente sind ebenfalls kleine Cerealien enthalten, welche nach Schinken und Salz schmecken. Auch hier ist das Schälchen sicherlich sehr innovativ und eine schöne Spielerei, aber eher ein kleiner Gruß, als ein richtiger Gang in einem 3 Sterne Haus.  So langsam bin ich wirklich hungrig, aber die Küche hört das Knurren meines Magens nicht und schickt stattdessen ein Glas in Espresso-Tassen Größe, in dem sich ein chemisches Gemisch von Earl Grey befindet, so dass man kalten und heißen Tee miteinander vermischt hat. Auch hier verhält es sich wie bei den vorherigen Tellern. Der Shot ist spannend zu kosten, aber eine besondere wohlschmeckende Erfahrung ist er nicht.  Es geht weiter in Gang 6 mit einem kleinen Lolly auf Basis einer Hähnchenleber, welche mit Haselnüssen verfeinert wurde und am Stiel zum Gast kommt. Es ist der erste Bite, der wirklich Spass macht, aber der Spaß ist nach zwei Bissen auch wieder vorbei, denn die Größe des Lolly’s hat auch wieder den Charakters eines Grußes aus der Küche.  Ein kurzes Resümee nach bislang sechs verkosteten Gängen; in jedem anderen 3 Sterne Haus wären diese 6 Gänge am Anfang des Abends auf den Tisch als Grüße aus der Küche gestellt worden. Etwas richtiges zu Essen gab es, mit Ausnahme des Brioche bislang noch nicht. Im nächsten Gang wird es skurril. Es wird eine Muschel gebracht, in welcher sich ein MP3 Player und Kopfhörer befindet, welche man aufziehen soll. Nun kann man Wasser plätschern und Möwen kreischen hören und bekommt dazu den „Sound of the Sea“ zu hören. Das Gericht wurde 2007 kreiert und der MP3 Player und die Kopfhörer sind sicher aus dem gleichen Jahr. Es ist der erste Teller, der nach etwas aussieht, was man mehr als dreimal kauen kann. Es befindet sich ein Schaum von Austern auf dem Teller, welchen man mit einem gepressten Staub von Tapioka vermischt und dieser schmeckt nicht nur spannend, sondern auch köstlich. Dazu gibt es jeweils drei kleine dünn aufgeschnittene Stückchen vom Oktopus, King Fish und Makrele. Der nächste Gang besteht aus einer Scheibe Brot mit Butter. Hört sich zwar langweilig an, aber immerhin gibt es eine Sättigungsbeilage, die den ersten Hunger stillt. Auch an den Nachbartischen kann ich ähnliches beobachten und so bestellen manche Tische 3 oder 4 Scheiben des Brots nach, um nicht vom Fleisch zu fallen. Wie schnell doch die Zeit vergeht, denn in Gang 8, dem zweitletzten Gang bevor es zum Dessert geht, gib es einen in Lakritz pochierten Lachs. Das Stück Lachs in der Größe von zwei aufeinander liegenden Streichholzschachteln wird ummantelt von Lakritz, welche den süßlichen Geschmack nur sehr zurückhaltend transportiert und so für den ungeübten Gaumen „runder“ machen soll. On top befinden sich ein paar Forellenroggen und als side gibt es zwei kleine Stückchen gegrillter Artischocke mit einer köstlichen Vanille-Mayonnaise.  Nun zum Hauptgang. Es gibt ein Stück Rehrücken, welches perfekt rosa gebraten wurde, aber leider fast kalt auf meinem Teller landet. Apropos Teller. Es werden fast ausschließlich Teller von Raynaud verwendet, welche ich auf Grund des Designs sehr schätze. Allerdings sind die Teller schon einige Jahre im Einsatz und das sieht man ihnen mehr als an. Jeder Teller weißt deutliche Gebrauchsspuren von Messer und Gabel auf und daher sollten diese dringend ausgetauscht werden. Zurück zum Rehrücken; dieser wird von einem Klecks Sellerie-Püree, kleinen säuerlichen Perlzwiebeln und einem Selleriesalat begleitet. Der Gewinner des Tellers ist zweifelsohne der Sellerie-Salat, denn dieser wurde kräftig mit Senf abgeschmeckt und wird zusätzlich mit kleinen Senfkörnern verfeinert. Das soll’s dann auch gewesen sein mit den „herzhaften“ Gängen und das Dessert wird eingeläutet. Hierzu startet die Patisserie mit einer Taffety Tarte, welche ursprünglich aus dem 17. Jahrhundert stammt. Die Ware besteht hauptsächlich aus Apfel, Salzkaramell, Blätterteig und einer leichten Creme auf Joghurtbasis. Ein wirklich köstliches Dessert, was schon sehr lange auf der Menükarte in der fetten Ente steht und an diesem Abend von Francesco Genovese perfekt umgesetzt wurde. Als zweites Dessert, wenn man es so nennen möchte, gibt es Weingummis aus Whisky-Basis von fünf verschiedenen Whisky Sorten. Das ist gut gemacht und fängt den Geschmack der einzelnen Whiskys hervorragend ein, hat aber im Großen und Ganzen nichts mit einem Dessert in einem 3 Sterne Haus zu tun. Zum Abschluss gibt es noch ein paar Petit Fours aus dem Sweet Candy Shop, für den ein kleines Puppenhaus angefertigt wurde und in dem sich die Petit Fours verbergen. Abschließend betrachtet ein Abend mit ganz viel Schatten und wenig Licht. Der Service rund um den sympathischen Restaurantleiter benötigt zwar etwas Zeit um aufzutauen, aber nach ca einer Stunde ist das Eis gebrochen und man kann sich locker und entspannt mit der Service Crew unterhalten. Auch macht das Küchenteam beim späteren Plausch einen entspannten und sympathischen Eindruck. Das kann aber leider nicht über das Hinwegtäuschen, was an solch einem Abend das Wichtigste ist. Die Weinkarte ist maßlos überteuert und unverschämt bepreist. Was das Essen anbelangt, hat man mit „Sound of the Sea“, dem Lachs, dem Hirsch und der Tarte gerade mal 4 „richtige“ Gänge vor sich stehen gehabt. Alles andere waren Portionen in Amuse Bouche Größe. Des Weiteren werden keine hochwertigen Produkte verwendet, was in Anbetracht des ausgerufenen Menüpreises auch sehr schade ist. Ich würde mir für die Zukunft weniger Show und mehr auf dem Teller wünschen, denn die fette Ente war alles andere als fett. Wenn ich Brot essen muss, um satt zu werden, gehe ich zum Bäcker und in kein 3 Sterne Haus.

However I felt a little let down by the wine pairing with a large amount not to our taste and very difficult to see how they paired with the food.  If this is your first experience into fine dining be sure to go with an open mind and expect your taste buds to be tested.  A lot of effort goes into the dishes so I don’t want to complain too much however there feels like a large amount of ingredients are “airrated” and there are some very very powerful flavours.  This being said you will remember every moment and look back with fondness and love to tell everyone of your story.

Recensito il 30 giugno 2022 	816	Data della visita:  giugno 2022	2	We went for lunch on one of the London train strike days, so a GBP 60 Uber ride took us to this very plain fronted establishment, but once inside the door the magic starts. I don’t think that anyone who goes to TFD expects just a good meal, this is showmanship, childish fun and invention on a plate. Service was slick and friendly, if a bit robotic, but every dish does need explaining, so I feel sorry for the staff in that regard. Every course was packed with flavour and delicious, lots of luxury ingredients like caviar were used, all beautifully presented on a succession of interesting tableware. We had a glass of champagne to start, a bottle of white wine and excellent coffees to finish, the bill just on GBP 900. We spent 4 hours in the calm and simple dining room and were not rushed to leave our table whilst we waited for our return Uber. An unforgettable afternoon that brings a smile to our faces for the sheer whimsy and inventiveness of the entire dining experience.

36	0	Interesting one-off experience - but no desire to repeat	Recensito il 29 giugno 2022 	140	Data della visita:  giugno 2022	7	"My wife and I attended as a self-indulgent treat to celebrate our 30th wedding anniversary.  I'm sure that nobody goes to The Fat Duck without some pre-conceived notions of what they may experience, given the fame of the restaurant and its creator, and the michelin awards that have come with it.  Surprisingly, the restaurant itself is quite noisy, with hard glass surfaces lining the walls, loudly echoing back conversations from other diners. Unsurprisingly, service was slick and friendly and ran like a well oiled machine throughout the evening. We had the Anthology Menu Volume 4 tasting menu - 11 courses, if bread and a bag of sweets count as courses, plus a bonus course not listed in the menu book because the oyster course had no oysters (you are given a 58 page menu book as a guide and a keepsake).  The food was all interesting and delicious but not as exceptional as we'd hoped, maybe Heston's media exposure and resulting foreknowledge of some of his previous inventions mean that its difficult to exceed customer expectations. Looking back, neither of us experienced the ""surprised delight"" from any of the dishes that I think we were both hoping for. Between us we indulged in both the Discovery and the Curiosity wine flights; 7 glasses in each, spread over our 12 courses. The wines (and saki) were all unusual but only a few paired nicely with the food and in hindsight we should have ordered a couple of nice bottles from the extensive wine menu instead.  In total it was £1,130 for our meal for 2, including wine flights and service. The meal was very different and special for that and we're glad we went. We both enjoyed the experience (it is more of an experience than a meal) but neither of us has a desire to revisit the restaurant, which in itself says something. We've enjoyed meals far more at restaurants with less michelin stars and significantly lower prices, so The Fat Duck can only get an average rating from us."

37	0	Good but not great - A story as old as the hills and time itself.	Recensito il 28 giugno 2022 	20	Data della visita:  giugno 2022	3	This was my 2nd time at the fat duck , the first was 6 years ago with my Fiancé. This time was celebrating with my Father for a special birthday.  Unfortunately all though good, this experience wasn’t up there with my first experience. They say never go back in life and maybe they are wise words. To start with the positives .. 1) the food (in the main ) is very good and some dishes exceptional. The fish dish with caviar was exceptional. The dessert was also exceptional and a lot of the smaller dishes were playful and ‘fun’ 2) The service was attentive (if not a little rehearsed) and the experience is an adventure. The glass was never empty and other than the initial wait (see negatives) the food flowed as it should do, not too long between courses but just enough time to chat. 3) As if was a special birthday they let us go to the kitchen (didn’t notice any other tables given that experience) it was very special to see the chefs at work and the environment. To the negatives.. 1) It was 40-45 mins before the first course came out (frozen cocktails) a little too long for me , first time it was circa 20-30 from memory.  2) One course was ‘off’ the oysters weren’t up to the chefs scratch and they were replaced with a cucumber alternative (not a great alternative) what annoyed me more was that with a wink the server said don’t worry we got a secret course to make up for it. But having been there before i knew that course was standard not a make up for the lack of oyster.  3) It’s uber expensive 2 peoples food with two bottles of the cheaper wine and a couple of liquor coffees with tip came to £1k. I understand it is a 3 star but £1k for 2 is mad. I’ve eaten equally as good locations for £300-400 for 2, it’s special not that special.  4) Less courses than the first time around. Last time around i left feeling exceptionally full this time it felt a little lite by 1-2 courses. First time there were two desserts and the sweet shop this time just 1 and sweet shop . 5) The fat duck has a cartel with the local taxi company that i believe MGMT might own a portion of. Taxi to the location was £13 independent on the way home (they called at the FD) was £40. Don’t get me wrong it was later but £40 for a 10-15min ride home is a shocking example of taking the suspected rich for a ‘ride’.  To summarise , it is a good experience , but i wouldn’t recommend going if my 2nd experience is the new average.

After eating at a couple of Michelin star restaurants I was beyond excited to try the fat duck! It was a 4 hour experience which was fine and went quite quickly. The food started to arrive and to begin with we were impressed and was enjoying the experience but as time went on it became clear that it was more about theatre than the quality of the food. Some dishes lacked flavour, something you don’t expect at a Michelin star restaurant. At the beginning of my experience I had a whole glass of wine spilt all down me and whilst accidents happen and the waitress was very apologetic, there was no compensation for this, not even a reduction in the service charge, so for the next 3 hours I had to sit soaking wet and stinking of white wine! My partner couldn’t have mustard which was a shame as most of the dishes contained mustard and we felt his substitute was poor. Staff were all lovely, informative and couldn’t fault them apart from not offering anything for me being covered in wine. After paying £1000 for the 2 of us we left feeling robbed, hungry and disappointed! Just goes to show the star rating doesn’t necessarily mean it’s better. I would much rather has returned to the other restaurants we have been to. Won’t be returning and won’t he recommending, people should save their money.  It’s as though the restaurant concentrates more on the accessories rather than the flavour of food.

My daughter and I decided to surprise our husbands with an evening at this iconic restaurant and paid the full deposit (ie - all but the alcohol). 2 days before this much anticipated event my husband & I both tested positive for covid. We were so disappointed that we couldn’t go. The restaurant were completely unhelpful about rescheduling and, despite saying previously they had a waiting list, apparently could not re sell our table. The lady my daughter spoke to on the phone even suggested we still go if our symptoms were mild as we were not legally compelled to isolate. I was shocked! How could we sit in a room full of diners knowing we were breathing virus into that room! The outcome: our daughter and son in law enjoyed their meal despite being so sad we were not there.

43	0	It's the best life time experience, like Glastonbury meets Stonehenge	Recensito il 27 maggio 2022 	192	Data della visita:  maggio 2022	2	Heston Blumenthal is not only brilliant, but he is also courageous. He challenges all the sense with a whimsical and culinary immersive experience that is well…PRICELESS! His latest Anthology is like seeing the Stones or the Eagles knowing you will hear favorites with a current twist and then be surprised by new songs that mirror the status of their matured musical life. Heston’s Anthology does just that, but on steroids. One does not go to the Fat Duck because its Happy Birthday or Happy Anniversary and expect a traditional nice meal as one would expect from the neighboring Waterside Inn, where traditional is the nature of their well deserved Three Stars. Heston combines traditional with the future; he doesn’t just push the envelope he tears it in half making two perfectly harmonious containers of joy from one simple single-use item. One goes to the Fat Duck because of its cuisine certainly, and because the amalgamation of tastes and ingredients are just not found anyplace else. When one can make a razor-thin lozenge taste exactly like a fish or plant that slowly dissolves in your mouth like a Listerine breath strip, you know that someone has worked hard to have you enjoy the moment. After the great nitrous oxide cocktails that explode in one’s mouth leaving a cool sensation for the next surprise, one immediately knows that they have entered a culinary palace with gems of taste and smell experiences not known anywhere else. The use of earphones playing sounds of the ocean is a Zen experience and sort of intermission to experience the next dish of sashimi fish served on a plater of glass over sand and the sea foam rising from the plate puts you in the ocean with the fish you are about to taste. Its like intermission at a football match which gives one time to savor the past and anticipate the future The service at the Fat Duck is outstanding, everyone of the servers has been extremely well trained and not only knows the menu but how the ingredients are prepared and mixed to produce what you are about to enjoy. Throw away the wine list as your wine server knows more about the wines than you will ever know so go for the pairings as they will surprise you as much as the courses. The choices were from all over the world, many from places that one would not realize were wine producing regions. The Fat Duck is not your “local” as the Hinds Head may be, but it creates the experience to have all of your senses challenged and there is nowhere else in the world where this can be achieved better than in Bray. As an added treat we were privileged to have the Wagyu beef which was like a beef butter, it was so tender one could cut it with a piece of paper but the taste was as if you were eating the grass it was raised on. Just outstanding! There are not enough stars in the Michelin Guide to reward the immersive experience of the Fat Duck and it’s my “go to” place whenever I am able to get a table.

We visited for the Fable Tree menu in 2019 and felt a little underwhelmed, change a little for a loT after this visit. Across the first two meals, we had had 2/3 of the courses served and none of them felt improved, indeed several were poorer than before, the most obvious being the Botrytis Cinerea dessert which was just a pale imitation of what we were served five years ago (which WAS my favourite dessert ever - sadly not any more!). Of the ""new"" courses, the sole veronique served was superb and the addition of sandwiches to the mock turtle soup was welcome. Just one dessert and the ""meh"" sweetshop sweets (no change there in 10 years, maybe that needs freshening up) to take home leads to an unbalanced menu At c. £400/head plus drinks, it was maybe 60% of the amount of food enjoyed back in 2012 (when you had your meal back home after a return from the seaside as courses 13-16) at double the cost and very difficult to justify a return in the future. Service was excellent (as you would expect from a 3-star restaurant) albeit seem to taper off a bit towards the end of the meal."

Our expectations weren't met; the service was mostly good and attentive but way to pushy when it came to the wine flight. The food was fine but no where near exciting or special enough compared to other Michelin star restaurants which are a fraction of the price, and the level of theatre wasn't special enough to make up for the deficiencies in other areas. At nearly £800 for two people we expected something really special and this just didn't deliver; we left feeling disappointed and ripped-off, which is the worst feeling when you have high hopes. 20 or 30 years ago this might have been cutting edge and exceptional, but nowadays there's plenty of really good restaurants doing excellent food at a much more reasonable price and our experience just didn't justify the ridiculous premium.

3	0	It's the best life time experience, like Glastonbury meets Stonehenge	Recensito il 27 maggio 2022 	192	Data della visita:  maggio 2022	2	Heston Blumenthal is not only brilliant, but he is also courageous. He challenges all the sense with a whimsical and culinary immersive experience that is well…PRICELESS! His latest Anthology is like seeing the Stones or the Eagles knowing you will hear favorites with a current twist and then be surprised by new songs that mirror the status of their matured musical life. Heston’s Anthology does just that, but on steroids. One does not go to the Fat Duck because its Happy Birthday or Happy Anniversary and expect a traditional nice meal as one would expect from the neighboring Waterside Inn, where traditional is the nature of their well deserved Three Stars. Heston combines traditional with the future; he doesn’t just push the envelope he tears it in half making two perfectly harmonious containers of joy from one simple single-use item. One goes to the Fat Duck because of its cuisine certainly, and because the amalgamation of tastes and ingredients are just not found anyplace else. When one can make a razor-thin lozenge taste exactly like a fish or plant that slowly dissolves in your mouth like a Listerine breath strip, you know that someone has worked hard to have you enjoy the moment. After the great nitrous oxide cocktails that explode in one’s mouth leaving a cool sensation for the next surprise, one immediately knows that they have entered a culinary palace with gems of taste and smell experiences not known anywhere else. The use of earphones playing sounds of the ocean is a Zen experience and sort of intermission to experience the next dish of sashimi fish served on a plater of glass over sand and the sea foam rising from the plate puts you in the ocean with the fish you are about to taste. Its like intermission at a football match which gives one time to savor the past and anticipate the future The service at the Fat Duck is outstanding, everyone of the servers has been extremely well trained and not only knows the menu but how the ingredients are prepared and mixed to produce what you are about to enjoy. Throw away the wine list as your wine server knows more about the wines than you will ever know so go for the pairings as they will surprise you as much as the courses. The choices were from all over the world, many from places that one would not realize were wine producing regions. The Fat Duck is not your “local” as the Hinds Head may be, but it creates the experience to have all of your senses challenged and there is nowhere else in the world where this can be achieved better than in Bray. As an added treat we were privileged to have the Wagyu beef which was like a beef butter, it was so tender one could cut it with a piece of paper but the taste was as if you were eating the grass it was raised on. Just outstanding! There are not enough stars in the Michelin Guide to reward the immersive experience of the Fat Duck and it’s my “go to” place whenever I am able to get a table.

4	0	Treated poorly - beyond the pale	Recensito il 26 maggio 2022 	1	Data della visita:  maggio 2022	12	Booked via Tock.  Restaurant called the day befor my reservation to tell me the table I booked and paid for is no longer available.  This level of customer service is not what I would have expected from a 3- star Michelin restaurant.  This was a special visit to the UK and I changed other plans to accommodate dining at the Fat Duck.  Would advise others to choose another fine dining option in the UK, as I might expect this lack of service and courtesy to also be reflected in the dining experience.

5	0	Losing its touch and uniqueness	Recensito il 15 maggio 2022 	92	Data della visita:  maggio 2022	2	"Returned for our 20th anniversary (after visiting in 2012 and 2017) and certainly left less impressed than on either of those first two visits. We visited for the Fable Tree menu in 2019 and felt a little underwhelmed, change a little for a loT after this visit. Across the first two meals, we had had 2/3 of the courses served and none of them felt improved, indeed several were poorer than before, the most obvious being the Botrytis Cinerea dessert which was just a pale imitation of what we were served five years ago (which WAS my favourite dessert ever - sadly not any more!). Of the ""new"" courses, the sole veronique served was superb and the addition of sandwiches to the mock turtle soup was welcome. Just one dessert and the ""meh"" sweetshop sweets (no change there in 10 years, maybe that needs freshening up) to take home leads to an unbalanced menu At c. £400/head plus drinks, it was maybe 60% of the amount of food enjoyed back in 2012 (when you had your meal back home after a return from the seaside as courses 13-16) at double the cost and very difficult to justify a return in the future. Service was excellent (as you would expect from a 3-star restaurant) albeit seem to taper off a bit towards the end of the meal."

7	0	Ripp-off	Recensito il 28 aprile 2022 	24	Data della visita:  aprile 2022	2	Na 2 gangen ben ik opgestaan, de rest van mijn gezeldschap na 5 gangen. De fat duck is peperduur maar dat is prima, zolang je verwachtingen waargemaakt worden. Het eten is ronduit saai ( wat zeer onverwachts was ) de bediening matig & ongeïnteresseerd, terwijl het decor niveau put niet ontstijgt. Zoals gezegd: een ripp off, puur gebaseerd op reputatie.

8	0	Something completely different	Recensito il 28 aprile 2022 	75	Data della visita:  aprile 2022	1	"We were a family party of 6 being treated by our offspring for my wife's ""significant"" birthday! The atmosphere was good and the staff all very pleasant and welcoming. The whole experience is very theatrical and each course clearly explained by a host. The food is certainly unusual but a cause for interesting conversation throughout. We were given a book which explains each course and the story behind it which is a big help. Certainly a life experience that we have wanted to try for years."	False	3,0	5,0	5,0	--	6	--	--	--	--	--	--	--	--	--	--	--	--	--	--
9	0	Sadly disappointing 	Recensito il 27 aprile 2022 	79	Data della visita:  aprile 2022	10	We try not to go to restaurants with too high expectations, but with a place like the Fat Duck with the hype around it and three Michelin stars you can't help but be excited. Our expectations weren't met; the service was mostly good and attentive but way to pushy when it came to the wine flight. The food was fine but no where near exciting or special enough compared to other Michelin star restaurants which are a fraction of the price, and the level of theatre wasn't special enough to make up for the deficiencies in other areas. At nearly £800 for two people we expected something really special and this just didn't deliver; we left feeling disappointed and ripped-off, which is the worst feeling when you have high hopes. 20 or 30 years ago this might have been cutting edge and exceptional, but nowadays there's plenty of really good restaurants doing excellent food at a much more reasonable price and our experience just didn't justify the ridiculous premium.
