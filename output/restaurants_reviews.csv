2	0	Return visit… good but lacking full 3 Michelin star finesse	Reviewed 4 weeks ago 	--	Date of visit:  May 2023	0	I’ve always felt that AD@Dorchester has been underrated in London - it’s consistently had 3 Michelin stars for an exceptionally long time and is relatively easy to find a table at. However my most recent visit was ever so slightly disappointing. Objectively, a great dinner - we had the full tasting with the top wine flight pairings - but there were too many imperfections for this to really be 3 Michelin stars. Small things like sloppily placed cutlery, inconsistent table service and long waits for attention - not a huge deal, and certainly first world problems, but all added to a sense that the restaurant was lacking that ultimate polish. Feels more like a place to go for fine dining tourists and instagrammers. Having said that, my wife and I both enjoyed the meal.

4	0	Grandi aspettative, ma esperienza non memorabile	Reviewed May 1, 2023 	--	Date of visit:  April 2023	0	Grandi aspettative ma qualche perplessità. Piatti di grande tecnica ma alcuni di scarsa emozione. Menù degustazione buono con la criticità di una lombatina di vitella (t-bone) non propriamente carne da 3 stelle Michelin e un dessert di sorbetto con un pre-dessert di sorbetto a parer mio è un’indiscutibile errore nella composizione di un menù. Servizio di altissimo livello con esclusione dell’opera sei sommelier per la quale si nota un abbinamento vini da rivedere nella degustazione combinata con inspiegabili abbinamenti fortemente disarmonici. Pinot nero californiano con vitella e barbabietola rossa che portava alla bocca una imbarazzante dolcezza. Pineau d’aunis Patapon rouge su selezione di formaggi tra cui un erborinato e conseguenti sensazioni post-sorso non pervenute . Un ottimo passito bianco di catarratto abbinato al sorbetto all’arancia sanguinella onestamente imbarazzante.	True	--	--	--	Dear Guest, Thank you very much for taking the time to share your feedback.

7	0	Where did everyone go?	Reviewed April 15, 2023 	--	Date of visit:  May 2022	1	I took my wife here to celebrate our 46 th Wedding Anniversary while in town for the Chelsea Flower Show. The initial meal and service was as one would expect but then everyone disappeared! we were seated near the street in an area away from the main dining room with two significant pillars blocking the view but with 3 other tables sharing the space. After finishing our mains, we sat for 35 minutes awaiting clearance of dishes and desert menus. We finally succeeded in signaling for the bill. While I can appreciate that some restaurants struggle with staffing, this clearly was not the issue here. There was plenty of staff but the pillars block their view of these tables and as the restaurant was nearly full their attention drifted away from us. A sad and disappointing end to what started out well but petered out dismally. What a shame.

A wonderful culinary journey from start to end - dishes served at the start had clean and refreshing flavours, followed on with bold, meaty flavours. Ended with cheese course and a beautiful sorbet dessert. At the end of the service, my partner was given a chocolate gift, very thoughtful! It was the perfect place to celebrate a special birthday.

9	0	Poor service	Reviewed February 3, 2023 	--	Date of visit:  January 2023	2	I visited Alain Ducasse at The Dorchester for my birthday with my wife. We had the tasting menu and the food was exquisite apart for the fish that wasn't anything special nor tasty. We very much enjoyed the medallion lobster, the scallop and the he venison.  The service however was a big let down for a 3-stars Michelin restaurant. We had a glass of champagne when we sat and the sommelier put maybe 50ml in my wife's glass while my glass was filled normally. I never saw that in any restaurant in the world, regardless of their price or how many Michelin stars they have. That was a bad way to start the diner and spoiled a bit the good feel factor of the arrival. The total bill for 2 tasting menus, 2 glasses of champagne at the beginning and half-bottle champagne during the diner was £561.  When we left and got our jackets, I noticed my Louis Vuitton pin wasn't on my jacket anymore. I told the staff and they started looking on the floor for it. I ended up finding it after a while, but not the whole pin, the back was still missing. That was rather annoying to see. I was told they are going to keep looking for it and that I would be contacted. I wasn't and after some days I got in touch with them. At first they were dismissive and when I told them I'm not happy with the way they're treating this a manager then called me. They told me they're still looking for the back part but I'm not expecting it to find it.  To spend above £500 on a diner and then to be disrespected I find unpardonable. I'm not going back there again.	False	2,0	1,0	5,0	--	Georgian M.

10	0	Nichts besonderes	Reviewed February 2, 2023 	--	Date of visit:  January 2023	0	Die Einrichtung eher langweilig- nun gut dies ist vielleicht Geschmackssache. Das Personal war sehr freundlich fast zu freundlich. Es fragte ständig wie es uns geht. Die Weinkarte ist sehr umfangreich aber die Preispolitik verstehe ich nicht. Beispiel ein 2019 Tignanello im EK ca 130 Euro dort für ca. 750 Euro umgerechnet, ein 2010 Castillo de Ygay Gran Reserva EK ca. 140 Euro dort 300 Euro. Teilweise sehr teure Preise beim Bordeaux. Das Essen war zwar gut aber mehr nicht . Die ersten 5 Gänge Jakobsmuscheln mit Kaviar eher fade. Die rote Beete mit Makrele gut. Der Hummer mit Pilzen, sehr gut die Soße, der Hummer fast schon zäh, der Hauptgang Wild- nichts besonderes. Für 3 Sterne fraglich aber dann kamen 3 kleine Stückchen Käse - Brie, Blauschimmel und Comte alle gut aber .... dann folgte eine Art Pre Dessert Sorbet gut- aber ein sehr ähnliches Dessert folgte zugleich. Sorbet eine Scheibe Zitrone und irgendeine Creme.  Alles in allem unerfreulich für 830 Pfund PS: Man wollte auch meiner Tochter ein Glas Champagner eingießen- die offensichtlich noch keine 14 Jahre alt ist. Es hätte wenn überhaupt gezielt gefragt werden müssen.

We were not disappointed quite simply the best meal I have ever eaten. We picked the tasting menu with a wine flight and when the first course came out I knew we were going to be in for a beautiful meal. The lobster dish was stunning and the wine choices complimented the food. The real highlight was getting to go into the kitchen and meet Jean- Philippe the executive chef.  Worth every penny and I'm so glad we picked here for our first three star meal. 	True	--	--	--	Dear Guest, Thank you very much for sharing your very kind feedback.

First of all the service and ambience is perfect - from the first interaction at the entrace all through the evening! Friendly, super professional, knowledgable and yet a little nice ”french formal” service to make it an evening to remember. We had the Tasing Menue and its a perfect choice, well balanced dishes presented in a perfect way - simply world class food. We did not go for the wine menue instead we selected wine and aperetifs from the excellent and extensive wine list - simply perfect! All in all a world class fine dining experience with world class service. If you once in your life want to dine at a three star restaurant this one should be high up on your go-to-list!!!

14	0	Very bad booking experience (for a £610 restaurant gift voucher)	Reviewed November 4, 2022 	--	Date of visit:  November 2022	1	Rarely do I find the time to write a review so it has to be about an extraordinarily good or bad experience. I contacted the reservation team for Alain Ducasse at The Dorchester on Wednesday evening as I wanted to offer a gift certificate for a total value of £610 for a decade birthday that happened the next day. I was explained that I needed to fill a PDF form, either with a specialized piece of software or by printing it then scanning it, in a much outdated fashion, and that I also needed to fill my payment information on a form on a website, even though the payment would be made later, in as much of an outdated manner. I wonder if all their clients need to be computer science engineers to be able to follow these parallel procedures. Everything could have been handled with a single online page with an instantaneous payment form. The same evening I dutifully filled the PDF form and sent the payment information. I was told they would check both the form and the payment information on Thursday and that they would send the voucher at the latest on Friday morning. This Friday afternoon I called my relative that was supposed to receive it and he hadn't. I then checked my mailbox and saw that the reservation team had sent me an email asking me to send the form, as if I had sent nothing! I called them, and after much difficulty in trying to get someone from that team—being told that the restaurant was closed even though the reservations team is supposed to be open before—, I was told to call after 6PM and ended up being called back before that. The agent coldly told me that they did not receive the email and did not seem concerned to look through their spam folder, even though I was in a cab and it was impractical for me to work with email before the office closed. Considering I didn't receive any delivery error message, I am doubtful that they didn't receive it. I eventually forwarded the initial email that contained the form, using my smartphone. Later this evening I finally received an email from a new person, the reservations manager, saying that everything was in order and asking me whether they should wait for the next weekday, on Monday, before sending the gift certificate that was planned for “tomorrow”! The “tomorrow Thursday“ from my email on Wednesday, had become a next week… Apparently my request hadn't been transferred to her with the proper context of a lost email and being already late. When I read and replied to this aggravating email 30 minutes later, I received an out-of-office email: “the reservations office is currently closed and will reopen on Saturday 12th November 2022”, which is 8 days later! (Why would they close for so long?) They hadn't bothered to call me to get my answer to this irrelevant question for which I apparently had only a few minutes to answer. I tried to call the reservation team number that had called me earlier but it wasn't publicly accessible “the number you're calling does not exist”, so I called the number in the email signature, then got transferred multiple times in an unceremonious manner the same as earlier, and finally talked to someone at the restaurant. She showed no empathy for my panicking over the risk to miss the deadline by four or eight days, and coldly informed me that the voucher had been sent after all, which I hadn't been informed of. At that point, I mentioned that I would appreciate if they said they were sorry about the many problems. She ignored it. Finally I received an email 30 minutes later, from the reservations manager who thought that yesterday was tomorrow, and who—at last!— apologized in due form and offered to check with their IT team about the lost email. She also called me another 30 minutes later, apologizing very politely, yet offering no commercial gesture. I personally consider that a symbolically added £30 to my £610 gift certificate would have made up for the displeasing experience and the stress that could have been avoided. As far as I'm concerned, that was a bit too late to accept their apology anyway, as that last mistake was the straw that broke the camel's back, but hopefully this review will help change their booking process. In the end, the voucher was sent one day late, which is acceptable, but at the cost of a great deal of stress on my part, which I feel is unacceptable for an establishment of this caliber. I can only hope that the experience of my relative at the restaurant will be exceptional to make up for it, hoping the service will not be as disdainful as some of the people I've had on the phone. I've had the experience of booking with several 3 star Michelin restaurants all over France and while there can always be a few issues or small misunderstandings, I have never been faced with such unapologetic nonchalance, until the late intervention of the reservations manager.

When entering the restaurant you immediately notice the class of the place as well as the quality of the finishes. The interior is modern playing with white and milky colours somehow reaching beige in some points. The tables are set in the space and well assembled. The service and the maitre are excellent in all situations of the evening. But the most important part is the food. The food is a world for its own. Classic with modern touches. Some experimental dishes as well that not always need to be on point but delineate the handwriting of the local chef.  A wonderful evening and I hope to visit this place soon again.

17	0	Giving this 5/5 despite there being some things I didn’t like because the food is too good not to	Reviewed October 16, 2022 	--	Date of visit:  October 2022	0	This place is expensive but worth EVERY penny for a very special occasion in my opinion.  I loved that we were able to have 1 tasting menu and 1 a la carte as most places the table has to have the same thing. I of course went for the tasting menu and I highly recommend it even if some of the things don’t sound like they are to your taste - for example I don’t like wasabi, aubergine or oyster and I was served all three at some point during my seven courses and LOVED every second of it. Our menu was:  1. Scallop with beurre blanc and caviar  2. Mackerel with beetroot and wasabi 3. Lobster medallion with chicken quenelle, perigold truffle and semonlina pasta  4. Turbot with blackcurrant and hazelnut 5. Veal with oyster and aubergine  6. Cheese selection 7. Vassout Pear As if this wasn’t enough food, there were multiple extras and amuse bouches plus lots of bread which was simply a delight! All the staff are great but there were three in particular who were very memorable and felt went above and beyond. Stupidly we didn’t get their names but one was the a young-ish man who served us each course (he has an English bull terrier dog if that helps) one was the gentleman who explained the menu and one was a lovely lady who was just generally around to answer queries.  The few things I didn’t like were firstly we arrived at 6pm for dinner and the doors were locked so we were standing outside with other people in this little doorway outside China tang like we were waiting for a rollercoaster or a cinema, it didn’t feel very sophisticated given the nature of the establishment. Secondly, one of the groups we were standing with were wearing trainers, T-shirts and jogging bottoms and initially they were denied entry. However, they claimed they visited yesterday in similar attire and the staff at the door said they would check with management. 5 mins after we were seated we saw them all enter the restaurant and take their seat. If you have dress code rules that we’ve all got to adhere to then so should they. It felt very much like they were allowed in as they had a lot of money to spend (don’t we all, we are after all at Alain Ducasse at the Dorchester.) The third thing I didn’t like which is short term is the the toilets are a mile away from the actual restaurant. A member of staff takes you through China Tang and across to the main ballroom toilets and waits for you as you’d get lost otherwise. She did kindly explain that they are using the ballroom toilets due to hotel renovations which is how I knew it was short term but still annoying to have to go outside and back inside just to go for a wee. The toilets are lovely I will say that! Would I recommend here as a 3 star Michelin restaurant choice, absolutely. This far exceeds the other 3 Michelin star place I’ve been to (which I won’t name.) I would also be intrigued to visit the Dorchester again for China Tang or the Grill as I’ve heard good things about them too.

18	0	Disappointed	Reviewed October 12, 2022 	--	Date of visit:  October 2022	0	Firstly the surroundings are a little imposing , as we were the first there , I found that the staff were constantly watching us and it made me feel a little uncomfortable and intimidated. The staff were excellent and attentive and indeed could not fault in anyway . We enjoyed the taster menu .. however I was disappointed with at least 3 of the courses. Several dishes were just too complex with flavours , example was the beetroot dish which in my mind was just a watery bowl of beetroot broth . One of the dishes had Greek yogurt in it and this was all I could taste..way too overpowering. Wines very expensive as was the Port and Cognac . We left feeling underwhelmed and void of any real food experience. To say I woke up this morning disappointed is an understatement . This was the highlight of our trip to London and it just left me feeling very deflated, never mind £1000 out of pocket . I would not go back and I’m afraid I could not recommend this restaurant to others. There are much much better restaurants in London and much cheaper . La Gavouroch by Michelle Roux is much much better . Sorry but this was a let down and by quite a bit .

20	0	Birthday Treat 	Reviewed September 9, 2022 	--	Date of visit:  September 2022	0	As a birthday treat, it doesn't get more opulent than the Dorchester, a first dining experience in a 3 michelin stared restaurant and it did not disappoint. The service from the moment we stepped over the threshold was outstanding. Very attentive staff but also finely balanced with a element of discretion.  Boris and Danielle did a fabulous job of looking after us, explaining each dish and wine pairing eloquently and with passion.  The food was delicious, going for the 7 course tasting menu. I was surprised to see 3 out of the 7 courses being either fish or shellfish and only 1 meat dish. As a fish lover this had no consequence to our choice but think for others it may deter people from choosing the amazing menu. One slight grumble was the renovation work meant going to the toilets meant walking out of the restaurant, outside and into the adjacent door, going down and up so stairs and round lots of corridors. I needed a breadcrumb trail to find my way back. This is only temporary but people with limiting mobility may struggle. Each dish was as good if not better than the last, the courgette starter and Lobster courses being outstanding. A beautifully discreet birthday dessert was also presented, I request no candles and a sign of respect for the passing of our queen earlier in the day, and the request was followed through. Overall a wonderful dining experience, thank you to everyone that made us feel special and welcome.	True	--	--	--	Dear Guest, Thank you for taking the time to share your very kind feedback.

As soon as we arrived, the door was opened for us by two members of staff working in synch. We were shown to our table and talked through the menu by the waiters. The service was incredibly attentive and friendly and we felt relaxed throughout the meal. The food was amongst the best we have ever tried and each course was well balanced and cooked to perfection. We really appreciated the small touches they put together because it was out Honeymoon. Overall, we would definitely recommend a meal at Alain Ducasse at the Dorchester and will definitely be returning in the future.

The restaurant has a nice decor and is laid out beautifully with large tables giving a nice view of the whole restaurant. The food was presented nicely and of a really high standard with very knowledge staff. I’ve eaten in many Michelin Star restaurants and whilst the experience was lovely I would say I have had better experiences at other restaurants within London.

We came from Bristol to London to celebrate my fiancé’s special birthday. The food was amazing. The combination of taste, texture of different ingredients and presentation were wonderful. The restaurant’s staff went above and beyond to make our dinner very special. The restaurant manager, Laura, Riccardo and other Italian waiter with a Greek name were wonderfully friendly and attentive to us. As a special treat to my fiancé we had an honour to meet a head chef Jean-Philippe Blondet and see his team. It was a very special moment. We look forward to having an occasion to dine again at Alain Ducasse with our whole family.	True	--	--	--	Dear Guest, Thank you very much for taking the time to share your very kind feedback.

25	0	Disappointing	Reviewed June 11, 2022 	--	Date of visit:  June 2022	1	We have eaten lunch and dinner here several times over the years and always enjoyed a superb meal, but this time it was not worth 1 Michelin star never mind 3. The courgette starter was dull and the teaspoon of caviar stirred into it a waste of caviar. When asked, I told it as it was and was offered the asparagus starter which was a kind thought but I wouldn’t have been able to eat the rest of my dinner. I should have accepted as the lamb main had an unacceptable amount of fat and gristle which left a rather meagre helping of edible meat. The chocolate pudding served in 2 parts was delicious. The lobster starter had to go back as it wasn’t adequately cooked, it had a gelatinous texture. Came back perfectly cooked but the dish as a whole was only “ok” according to my husband, which is particularly disappointing as I ate that dish on our previous visit and it was sublime. The John Dory main was good. At the prices charged every mouthful should be perfect. Even the canapés were dull. Yummy petite fours though and we took what we didn’t eat home.

26	0	Disappointing Gastronomic Experience	Reviewed June 7, 2022 	--	Date of visit:  June 2022	0	Been here before 7 yrs ago when I got engaged. Decided to repeat the experience for my 40th Birthday. Previously had an extensive menu but now only 7 dishes (which you can have either have as starter/main/desert or 7 course tasting menu). Offered a glass of complementary Champagne as they were aware it was my birthday (my wife said it was lovely but all alcohol wasted on me as I don't really drink) which was nice of them. We opted for tasting menu. Waiting staff not coordinated and nearly walking into each other. Other waiting staff appeared to be lost walking around the restaurant carrying trays full of food. One of the waitresses has a particularly nasty habit or cracking her fingers and other joints whilst walking around and even when serving at the table. Some of the waiting staff obviously despise each other (as per body language) and would rather be elsewhere. Food was nice but not deserving of 3 stars (wonder what the criteria is these days for 3 stars) as our lobster was just warm with tepid chicken quenelles. Other dishes were so-so. Food should be perfect as only 7 dishes to deal with. Drinks obviously 3-4+ times mark up on off-license prices (those that can be bought at offy).  Will go out for a steak next time.

Food was meagre and fluffed up to sound huge when it was tiny and not great tasting. Wines overpriced and again small amounts despite charging up to £500 extra per person for the pairing. We had to hunt around the tiny mains sauces to find the lamb chop which was even smaller than a 50p coin. Bread was given out sparingly and we had to ask for more - small slice by slice portions. They had extensive works going on and we could not enter at the main door but walk all round the corner in our formal outfits. One couldn't even access the tiny ballroom toilets without being escorted a long way to avoid the dusty works. Definitely over-hyped place - I don't know how they get 5 stars; makes me suspicious! Also it was my birthday and I was astonished to see the very tiny dessert course which everyone was given but mine had a small candle on it! And the well-advertised chef's tour for birthdays never materialised. Thanks for a wonderful birthday celebration -NOT!!

Auch die Tisch-Deko inklusive Besteck und Geschirr ist sehr durchschnittlich.Zum Beispiel klobiges Steak-Messer zum Fisch. Viel enttäuschender ist aber das, was auf die Teller kommt.Ordentliches,aber bei allen Gängen langweiliges Essen, nicht besonders präsentiert. Man kann sich schon am nächsten Tag an keinen der 7 Gänge mehr erinnern.. Das ist maximal einen Stern wert, niemals 3. Man fragt sich, was die Michelin-Inspekteure eingeworfen haben, als sie zu ihrer Beurteilung kamen! Höhepunkt das Abends war, dass das Restaurant(3 Sterne im Dorchester-Hotel!) nicht in der Lage war, ein Taxi für uns zu organisieren und wir 11/2 Stunden warten mussten, bis wir selbst einen Transport bekamen.Natürlich ohne eine Entschuldigung oder eine kleine Einladung seitens des Restaurants!

They also replaced the wines with Non-alcoholic tea juices.  We had the flower garden, coco bean soup for starters and I had the pollock and my fiance had the duck breast for mains. Amuse bouche was delicious, our 3 courses were of decent size and when dessert came we were both so full up we were trying so hard to finish our dessert. Oops I forgot to mention I think we had a lot of bread before that as the bread and butter was delicious!  For 3 course for £70, it was definitely worth it.

38	0	Delicious food with an extensive menu, not so keen on the service	Reviewed April 6, 2022 	--	Date of visit:  April 2022	0	Extensive menu including an a la carte option with variety of flavours and textures. Food is easily the best thing about this restaurant and is worth the money. The meals are cleverly put together and the entire menu is an experience. The decor and overall atmosphere is more relaxed than I expected which is refreshing. Its a very calm place to eat and you're given space and time to enjoy your meal.  The only thing that let this place down was the service. I don't know if the restaurant was just short-staffed on the day I attended, but it felt like everyone was rushed off their feet. I really wanted to learn more about the dishes but the staff were very eager to leave once they had presented each dish, looking around while they were talking to you and rushing away before you could say anything. Everyone was running around and you could tell that you were holding them up by asking questions which made me reluctant to engage more with the menu and dishes (isn't that part of the entire 'fine dining experience'?). I ended up leaving early because I just felt I wasn't getting much aside from a nice meal and felt I was getting in the way. Judging by the rest of the reviews this does just seem to be a one-off experience and I'm looking forward to returning in the near future to hopefully a more pleasant meal. Despite this, I would recommend this restaurant for those interested in a unique culinary experience.	False	5,0	3,0	5,0	Dear Guest, Thank you very much for sharing your kind feedback.

39	0	Seasons in the Sun as the song goes	Reviewed March 26, 2022 	--	Date of visit:  March 2022	0	"Not been since December I believe. Many changes on the floor with an excellent new RM, truly excellent. The staff is smiling, and genuinely so, not faking it which is so important in a restaurant. We all have our pbs, especially nowadays and a smile may not change the world but a nice evening. En cuisine, also big changes, took a long menu, much more refined than before, over the years, excellent sauces, jus, cuissons, highly refined would be my world. Nice visuals. One suggestion, know it costs but each dish would be so much more nicely presented with a sous-assiette. It changes everything imo. The less is more is so 1990's... Obviously, not everything I agree with but that's my taste like a brioche there, a bouillon, the choice of a fish (when I taste a dish, I try to taste the ingredients separately and then together when possible). Here they respect the seasons for the vegetables, the fish (there is a book that all chefs should have on their shelf and know by heart: Les saisons de l'océan de Christopher Coutanceau ). You think all 3* or even 2* restaurants do that and respect seasons and sustainability? Well i had a pea puree a few weeks ago in a 2* for ex.... And when you have game all year long in a 3* restaurant , even if it is d'elevage? No! Seasons were invented so we can appreciate the season's products AT THEIR BEST not when they are AVAILABLE. It is not because you can get it, source it from a supplier anywhere in the world, that you should serve it. We can all get cherries in December in London. Is that the right thing to do? There is a dish with a mini souffle -would have sworn double cuisson but it is not, a little bit like a la Suissesse/Gavroche) with yellow wine and truffles. A killing we say in French. I can imagine one day they will serve a real souffle, light and elegant like a small isolated cloud in a summer sky with hints of yellow wine, truffles, and aged Comte..... But maybe they don't know how to do it...? :)! They probably don't...! :) That would be a classic 3* dish imo. Yesterday was maybe one of the best meals I had in this restaurant. At the moment, this team in the kitchen and on the floor is at its best. Let's hope they don't lose focus. The hotel is under restoration, there is a corridor to go to the men's room. A suggestion: a few decorative print sets hanging on the curtains would make it less ""chantier-like"". Just an idea. The wine list is on the expensive and difficult side. My own choice of wine yesterday was not great. My fault but the wine list is the weak point of this restaurant."

We were not disappointed. HIGHLIGHTS: both ordering the tasting menu, the Jerusalem artichokes with Kristal caviar cream simply melted in your mouth; the lobster medallion, chicken quenelles and Périgord truffle with semolina pasta was flavorful and nicely balanced; turbot, salsify, razor clams and black garlic, parsley, ripe tomatoes, and citrus was delicious, subtlety sour and sweet, allowing the flavor of the turbot to ascend; ending with a fabulous pineapple, galanga sorbet, the latter of which mostly found in Thai cuisine – citrusy with hints of pine. The BIGGEST HIGHLIGHT, however, was being invited into the kitchen to meet Executive Chef Jean-Philippe Blondet himself, who was incredibly gracious. Service was world-class with kudos to Mattia Marcelli and his superb staff. No doubt we'll be back.

We had the second which again was as good as the food it was paired with.	True	--	--	--	Dear Guest, Thank you very much for sharing your feedback following your visit.

We both had the 7 course taster menu.  Every course served just got better and better as the evening progressed. The waiters knowledge of the food and its provenance was incredibly impressed.  The Sommelier knowledge of the wines was amazing and to have an opportunity to visit Jean Phillipe Blondel in the kitchen made our evening.  For me/us a once in a life time experience made memorable by every member of staff in the restaurant.  Absolutely stunning evening, thoroughly recommended, well done guys 🥂👏👏👏👏	True	--	--	--	Dear Guest, Thank you very much for sharing such a lovely review following your recent visit.

The food was amazing, service on point and atmosphere perfect.

46	0	Not a Michelin three star experience	Reviewed February 23, 2022 	--	Date of visit:  February 2022	1	For a Michelin 3 star establishment we expected something quite exceptional for the prices charged. The food was very good, don't get me wrong, but with the exception of two dishes out of the seven, there was no 'wow' factor. The signature lobster and chicken quenelles dish was exceptional, as was the Jerusalem artichoke and Kristal caviar cream starter. As for the rest of menu, there are plenty of other restaurants in London where the food is more inventive and tastier at a fraction of the price - Lyles or Story being two such examples.  But my biggest gripe was the exceptionally slow service, especially towards the end of the evening. We were there 4 hours in all. we had to wait about 20 minutes just to get the bill, and would have probably had to wait much longer if we hadn't put on our coats and stood at the exit on the verge of leaving. I had no idea what was in the desert as there was no explanation from the waiters. There was no hint of an apology when we pointed out the slow service as we were leaving. It put a dent on the whole experience. The other issue was the fact that we were quite close to the door leading down to the kitchen. At one point the our area was enveloped by the smell of cigarette smoke that wafted in from either the kitchen or the area where the waiting staff take their break. It was so bad my wife had to leave the table mid-service. Again hardly a Michelin 3 star experience.

Therefore my expectations for here with their 3 stars was very high - Well, WOW, they exceeded my expectations. My wife and I visited on Friday evening, we chose the 7 course tasting menu with wine pairings from their Icon's collection. The food; simply amazing. The service; unbeatable. The wine knowledge; world class. The setting/decor; perfect. We paid £1,970.00 for the two us, at that price everything must be perfect, it was, thank you very much.

50	0	A sour taste	Reviewed January 26, 2022 	--	Date of visit:  January 2022	0	"Such a hard review to write because part of me has the whole ""but I'm just the customer, what right do I have to criticise a three star restaurant?"". But also I'm the customer who just spent over £700 on the seven course tasting menu for two (plus a bottle of champagne).  Ok, so drinks were great, we chose the champagne well and had two glasses of red wine (Chianti) and two sweet wines to end with. On to the food... The amuse bouche was delicious, simple, light but full of flavour we were left expectant of what was to come. The bread was, well, very nice as was the accopanied by butter. Next came scallops with cauliflower and caviar, for me this was a real disappointment, while the citrus jus and cauliflower were lovely the scallop was a tiny slither and lost in the strong flavour of the jus.  ""Second course"" was sea bass with radish and samphire, again another delicate flavour for me lost completely to its accompaniments. A ceviche or sashimi approach would have worked better here but this is ""french cuisine"" after all. Next came the signature dish, lobster, chicken quenelles with pasta. Yes, this was truly amazing, indulgent and beautiful, and understandably their standout, left me even more confused as to the two previous courses. Again, the next dish of turbot with artichoke was devine, carefully seasoned and tastefully served it was just beautiful. Last of the ""protein"" dishes was venison with kalibos cabbage, again beautifully and prepared and tasted just perfect. On to cheese.. a dish which I struggle to count as one of my ""seven"" courses from a tasting menu, yes they were tasty but I honestly expect each dish from a tasting menu to be actually cooked / prepared, not simply pieces of something made earlier with some bread. Lastly the chestnut / yuzu mont blanc which, honestly was just overpowered by yuzu. Nice for some perhaps, but not to my taste. A few chocolates to finish and we're done.  In conclusion I was left disappointed. Of the seven dishes I would only really remember the lobster, turbot and venison. The starters were lacking, the cheese I wouldn't consider a ""course"" and the mont blanc overpowered by yuzu. Honestly, not worth the money."

51	0	Wonderful Christmas Lunch!	Reviewed December 28, 2021 	--	Date of visit:  December 2021	2	We stayed at the hotel Christmas Eve and Christmas day. We went to lunch at this restaurant on Christmas day. For 3 hours, we enjoyed the wonderful service and food. There were 6 courses for lunch and I have to say that we were absolutely ‘full’ at the end as each serving was on the more generous side. We both had to lie down for a few hours afterwards (probably should have gone for a walk in the rain). The service was very attentive. The atmosphere is stark but warm and as the restaurant filled up, became quite buzzy. Obviously this dining experience is not cheap but worth every penny for special occasion. The staff at the hotel and the restaurant went to enormous efforts to ensure that everyone had a wonderful Christmas experience. Recommended.

Four people on the table, three had the same main course option, I chose another. All of the meals came out the same, I mentioned to the waiter that I had the wrong main, I was more than happy to eat this, not a problem, mistakes happen. After I had eaten this course, empty plates were placed in front of the other three guests, then the correct meal was brought out for myself? I’m now confronted with the situation of eating another course, whilst the others watch on with the fore-mentioned empty plates. There was no need for this baffling resolution. Surely, it would be move on from the mistake, as I were not bothered, or give everyone the meal?

59	0	How is this place a Michelin 3 star? 	Reviewed October 23, 2021 	--	Date of visit:  October 2021	2	My friends and I have visited many Michelin star restaurants and this is by far the worst experience we’ve had.  We dinned at the Table Lumiere, which was beautiful. But the food was mediocre, presentation was quiet boring and old-school, and the service was the worst I’ve experienced in a fine dinning restaurant. We were rushed into the first course. The waiter literally shoved the plate in front of my face while I was eating my bread. He held it in front of me, and without saying a word waited for ME to move the bread plate to the side. He then sat the dish down and left without telling us anything about the dish.  The bill also came out incorrectly at the end. We had to pay a holding deposit for the table, which should have been deducted from our bill but wasn’t. They fixed this for us but it was a very amateur mistake in my opinion. It’s not like they just opened the table for reservation… and I believe a deposit has always been required to book the Table Lumiere.  Needless to say I will NOT be going back to any Alain Ducasse restaurant in the future. And I seriously wonder how this place got its Michelin 3 stars…. 	True	--	--	--	Dear Guest, Thank you for taking the time to share the comment regarding your experience on Table Lumière at Alain Ducasse at The Dorchester last Friday evening. I am very sorry to hear of your disappointment in regards to the service, I do apologise for the genuine mistake regarding the deposit not taken off the final bill and I have discussed this matter with the team in order to avoid that this can happen again in the future. The whole experience on Table Lumière lasted for more than 4 hours, however I would like to apologise if you felt rushed during the dinner as this is certainly not what we want the guest to feel I always greet everyone that visits the restaurant and I had the pleasure to meet you and your guests on the evening and look after you personally, I am however surprised about the comment regarding the food as the exchange we had during the meal were very positive after every dish was served so this was unexpected. Once again, I would like to thank you for your kind comments as they help us to improve and strive for excellence.

Expected more from a fine dining (supposedly) Michelin star earned institution. Due to my late reply to their dietary requirements I was refused service and blatantly asked not to come to the Restaraunt because the manager said they can’t serve me. After we’ve paid £600+ for our seats, we weren’t even offered a partial refund. Horrendous experience. We’ve been to exclusive sushi restaurants in Japan and they were always very accommodating and welcoming. Seriously they should rethink their managers’ employment. He was extremely rude and I had to ask him to lower his voice numerous times. He smirked and called me entitled when I said I was a paying customer. Truly despicable.

However the calmness of most places I've been too with the sushi master behind the counter was no where to be found. Instead it was several people all out of sync with each other. The sushi itself was ok, nothing great especially for that price. I suspect the amount of truffle used and o-toro jacks up the price, however I expected something a little more. Putting truffle all over so many things gets a little boring.	False	1,0	1,0	2,0	--	R R	--	Tripadvisor member since 2022	--	1 Contribution	--	1 City visited	--	--	--	--	--	--	--

This is authentic, quality omakase. The chefs prepared the food with exquisite precision, the ingredients chosen were those only a true sushi master would choose. We were totally blown away. The Michelin guide needs to take a long hard look at itself, this place deserves at least 2 Michelin stars. Their inability to rate at this level shows that they are nothing more than a boys club.

66	1	Delicious, but extortionate	Reviewed February 4, 2022 	--	Date of visit:  February 2022	2	The food is delicious, and served exquisitely, but we struggle to describe the experience without being blinded by the price of the meal and the feeling of being milked for more money. There were 6 of us, and the restaurant ushered us out within 2 hours due to another booking after us. The waiters assured us that we had finished our wine and sake, but refused to show us the empty bottles. I would like to recommend the restaurant to others, but we paid £500 a head for 6 people for the menu and for the cheapest bottle of wine and sake per head. Including service.  I am very disappointed to be negative, but we have left with the over-arching feeling that we have been ripped off at sheer cost of the bill. We feel a fair price would be ~£150-£200/head based on the true value of the wine/sake.

The ingredients are average at best, some not even fresh The starters were bland and tasteless  The nigiri fish quality was decent however everything has been soaked in SOY and all one can taste is the soy The only decent part of the meal was the handroll at the end which was just below the quality you would get at your local Nobu Save your money and go elsewhere - truly disappointing experience and very clear why all 3 Michelin stars were taken away.

72	1	Perfection	Reviewed May 23, 2021 	--	Date of visit:  May 2021	2	It's quite a trick to pull off such relaxed and professional elegance. For some - with the astronomical prices - the expectation would be a rather solemn affair, but that would be a real shame as the personality of the team shone bright alongside the magical food. A was a little apprehensive when the first course was served - a very fresh dish but no real complexity of flavour that I could tell anyway. I needn't have been - from that moment on, everything that we were given to eat was remarkable. The tempura was like nothing I've ever tasted and I don't have the vocabulary to adequately describe it. Melt in the mouth doesn't do it anything like justice.  The theatre of seeing the food prepared alongside some interesting chat and banter really made the experience special. I'd never been a fan of Sake - but I enjoyed it very much. Yes it's expensive, yes they have lost their michelin stars, but it was faultless and one of, it not the, best meal I've ever eaten. Can't wait to go back :-)	False	5,0	5,0	5,0	--	Mark R	Level  4  Contributor 	Tripadvisor member since 2012	Man from Tonbridge, United Kingdom	23 Contributions	48 Helpful votes	17 Cities visited	2 Photos	Foodie, Thrill Seeker, Nightlife Seeker	 14	 4	 0	 2	 3

75	1	Continues to be exceptional 	Reviewed February 29, 2020 	--	Date of visit:  March 2020	1	With the departure of Mr Araki and the loss of the three stars, questions were raised as to whether the next chef could continue with the same perfection and quality of ingredients. Having been back it is obvious that the level has not changed and we were extremely impressed from start to end. The food is creative and extraordinary. Yes the atmosphere is more casual and different from what it was but it “works” and reflects, as it should, the personality of the new head chef. We loved it.

76	1	A truly exceptional Omakase experience	Reviewed January 30, 2020 	--	Date of visit:  January 2020	2	"My wife and I were here for her birthday. Last time we went to an Omakase, it was Jiro Roppongi, very large shoes to fill. Yesterday's experience was absolutely incredible in every way. First this is a true omakase experience, however a bit more relaxed than in Japan. The chef prepares the fish in front of the guest and does the right amount of explaining. Then, there is the food, and I must say that from my perspective, this is very close to what we experienced at Jiro. Not exactly the same, slightly more ""unorthodox"" but outstanding nonetheless. And the chef and his team are really friendly ! Yes it is incredibly expensive, and yes this type of experience means there are more rules to follow, but I cannot understand how Michelin took out all the Stars. From my perspective, an absolute certitude some of them will come back next year.

77	1	Disappointing experience with the new head chef	Reviewed December 14, 2019 	--	Date of visit:  December 2019	3	Unfortunately for the new head chef, I had eaten here when it first opened (before any Michelin stars). The calm focus and dedication of the master chef made it unlike any other dining experience in London - not just amazing quality food and craftmanship in front of you but a serene ambiance that made the food the focus of the whole experience. It allowed you to really appreciate the meal and in an unrushed relaxed approach with the head chef, his apprentice and his wife managing the front of house elements. I was therefore really looking forward to coming back and experiencing it again. I put the lost Michelin stars down to the change of chef but also felt that Mr Araki wouldn't leave this flagship of Japanese cuisine bearing his name to anyone unready or unprepared. I think you can guess where I am going with this. The end result was a massive disappointment. So many staff members (6 or 7) for ten guests, each falling over each other to clear or serve or have a conversation with the guests about whatever (boxing, holidays, etc.). Mistakes made in front of everyone and so much commotion that it destroyed the celestial atmosphere from before. For the price being paid, you expect everything to be perfect and the service quality and ambiance was a real let down. In my opinion, not professional. With Chef Araki, you felt there was a person who had dedicated his life to perfection. With the new Chef, it felt slapdash, too casual and a world away from someone looking to reach the same heights. Save your money and buy a flight to Hong Kong instead to see the real thing.

78	1	Best Japanese ever !	Reviewed December 12, 2019 	--	Date of visit:  December 2019	0	Having read that they lost their 3 Michelin stars I was reluctant to try the restaurant. All my apprehensions were unnecessary. Chef Marty Lau and his team served up one of the best sushis and other Japanese classics with a twist that’s absolutely outstanding. I have been to many Michelin starred Japanese restaurants in the world but this one stands out.  The initial thought that the price of the meal is high because they had 3 Michelin stars were unfounded as they used ingredients that were very exclusive and expensive generously. Without giving away the surprise you will get when you dine there, some of the ingredients they used were Caviar of the best quality and rarity, fresh white truffles, lobsters, fattiest tuna etc.  I am not easy to impressed but the Araki definitely was outstanding. Well done to Chef Marty Lau who is personable, friendly and an amazing chef ! Thank you for the best Japanese meal in the world !

79	1	Kyoto meets Mayfair	Reviewed November 17, 2019 	--	Date of visit:  November 2019	1	This week I hired The Araki for dinner to celebrate a friend’s milestone birthday. I had been before when Mr Araki was there and the restaurant held 3 stars so was curious how it might have changed since the Michelin inspectors made the decision to strip the establishment of all three stars in their most recent publication. When initially trying to contact the restaurant to discuss the evening I had some difficulty getting hold of them which seemed strange but after some persistence I got through to Marty Lau, Head Chef and he was extremely helpful from then on. Although he usually doesn’t reveal the menu until the night he understood my concern for it to be perfect and kindly sent me the menu in advance and I have to say it was absolute perfection.  My next challenge was the drinks pairings and I was surprised that the wine selection was relatively limited and mainly focussed on Burgundy as a region. When I spoke to Marty about this he said there was no problem to pay corkage of £50 per bottle / £100 per magnum and bring our own so I asked my wine supplier to pair the wines to the menu and Marty helped with the sake selection and this worked really well. In terms of the experience, I really cannot fault the preparation, passion, quality or execution of what we experienced. The skill and precision of what the team here deliver has to be seen to be believed and it really feels like a privilege to dine there. It’s an experience which is unparalleled in the UK and more reminiscent of meals I have had in Japan, albeit with a European twist in terms of some of the fresh ingredients they use such as Exmoor caviar and Spanish belly tuna.  I enjoyed the meal even more than when they held three stars as the quality of the food was as good if not better but the engagement with our group was more friendly and more personal. Well done to Marty and the team for an amazing job, thank you for you amazing hospitality and wishing you all continued success in the future at your very special venue! Fantastic!

81	1	Extremely high quality seafood but bring proof of reservation	Reviewed October 4, 2019 	--	Date of visit:  September 2019	1	Master Araki may be gone, but his apprentice and former right-hand man, Marty Lau, gave an outstanding performance during our meal. With just ten diners, this is about as intimate as a group meal could be. We had a bit of an issue upon arriving as the company that booked our dinner did it under the booker’s name rather than under my name. But in the confusion, Mr. Lau quickly stepped in and resolved the matter. Fortunately, we brought the documented credit card proof or our reservation. We were really upset at the situation as we were close to being turned away. Two eager guests waiting, two seats awaiting, fortunately common sense prevailed. And so the festivities commenced. Mr. Lau and his two associates skillfully and artfully prepared one flight after another of seafood themed dishes starting with a nest of delicious, gently twirled thick noodles made of sea bream that were dusted with urchin roe and topped with caviar. Umami perfection! Then another seafood preparation draped in a creamy urchin sauce, finished with a drift of truffle shavings. As a palate cleanser, the fattiest portion of tuna belly was served as sushi. Another portion of fish, covered with a caviar-like paste, topped with truffle was presented. Wonderfully fresh sea urchin wrapped in seaweed was creamy and sweet. An incredible hunk of Tasmanian abalone made for a superlatively sumptuous bite or two. Diced Scottish salmon topped with white caviar was light and subtly flavored. Several other seafood preparations were delivered as well. To finish, a barely poached fig in a light, sweet sauce. The fish dishes were outstanding. All ingredients were of impeccable quality and freshness. Just the right amount of warmth was applied to each creation during its preparation to render it melt-in-your-mouth at the time of consumption. I would have liked some Wagyu beef, seafood variety, perhaps another desert offering in the line-up but the quality of the meal was nevertheless outstanding.

82	1	4* food at a 5* price	Reviewed September 22, 2019 	--	Date of visit:  September 2019	2	There is no doubt it's great quality and it's a fun experience but I have had better meals for a fraction of the price.  Of the 10 or so courses/mouthfuls, I disliked two, two were really memorably special and the rest was nice - the ratio of that is just not good enough for me at £450 a head. Too often I just tasted soy sauce rather than fish which is criminal! And my favourite bit shouldn't have been the pickled ginger... Lovely as it is. The staff/chefs are exceptionally friendly and knowledgeable; I liked watching them work.  If £450 is nothing to you then, sure, go. Go weekly like the people next to me! It's DEFINITELY very nice! But I can't see myself going back; I'd rather go to four 1* Michelin places.

83	1	Amazing	Reviewed September 17, 2019 	--	Date of visit:  September 2019	4	Ok, so the first thing to say is this restaurant is extremely expensive. You really do need to know that - I think the cheapest bottle of wine was around £160, saki around £130, but i’m pretty sure i won’t ever taste saki as good as that again.. However, the second thing to say is that you only live once, and it’s AMAZING. 10 guests, looked after impeccably, a real experience and fantastic food. Although I wouldn’t necessarily say the food on its own is the absolute best 3 Michelin star there is (or 2 star if you include Sat Bains) it’s down to personal taste and it is definitely up there, it’s unique, and it’s part of a whole evening that is worth experiencing at least once in your life.

85	1	Sushi will never be the same again	Reviewed August 1, 2019 	--	Date of visit:  July 2019	3	I will be honest that originally I didn't intend to dine in this restaurant, even though I do like sushi. As you probably have already noticed, the price is very high, and in addition - as stated in other reviews - you may leave slightly hungry. Meanwhile I have been recommended by other restaurant staff (people I respect very much) to dine at The Araki, so... The menu has to be paid upfront at the time of booking, while drinks and service will be charged on the night. There are two sittings per night: one at 6 p.m., the other at 8.30 p.m. The experience takes two hours, and I went for the late sitting. Please note that Amex and Diners are not accepted. Only ten seats are available (+ an additional private dining room) at the counter. Behind the counter several chefs including head chef Marty Lau, who took over from the restaurant founder Mr. Araki in early 2019, are preparing the food right in front of you. Mr. Lau is open to your questions and is very good at explaining backgrounds for sushi, traditiions and also his own background.  The selection of sushi is quite classic mainly focused on rice, fish and shellfish. Tuna seems to be a speciality served different ways. Luxury ingredients like truffle, albino and classic caviar and abalone are present as well.  Every guest will receive the same food, which is extremely fresh. Usually it takes less than 30 seconds from a piece of suhsi has been prepared, until the guest has eaten the food. Rice is a world of its own: small portions are constantly being prepared in order never to use rice, which has been cooked more than a couple of minutes before serving. Shortcuts don't exist. For me the most groundbreaking part of the experience was the rice being served slightly warm - it may sound strange, but the temperature made a huge difference from all other sushi, I have had in my life. Dining here was an event in terms of quality of the food as well as the experience sitting at the counter enjoying the hospitality - and hospitality was indeed taken to another level. If anyone asks me, if he or she should go to The Araki, I will recommend to forget about the price level and make a reservation as soon as possible. Does a restaurant, which serves only sushi deserve three Michelin stars? I believe yes. This was indeed a once in a lifetime dining experience, and I can honestly say, that sushi is never going to be the same again. A warm thank you to all of the staff at The Araki.

87	1	Это не еда- это путешествие и опыт.	Reviewed July 4, 2019 	--	Date of visit:  July 2019	0	The Araki. Японский ресторан в Лондоне.Это удивительное место, где все, что вы пробуете- это не еда. Это опыт. Это путешествие в другой мир и другую культуру. Всего 10 человек гостей- зрителей, сидящих на высоких стульях. А перед ними театр. Театр, где вместо актеров- повар и его помощники. Их движения выверены, точны и продуманы, они двигаются в такт внутренней музыке этого представления. Каждое новое блюдо- символ. Смешение необыкновенных компонентов и вкусов, которое в итоге приводит к созданию чего-то абсолютно непревзойдённого и нового. По сути это творчество самого высокого класса. Сдержанная, стильная, истинно японская простота интерьера заставляет помнить о главном- о сцене, где актёры движутся и творят чудо.  И когда ужин заканчивается- это сродни тому, как пустеет театр, и ты остаёшься в потрясении от того нового опыта и взгляда на мир, который они тебе подарили....

89	1	When is three Michelin stars not three Michelin stars?	Reviewed June 21, 2019 	--	Date of visit:  June 2019	14	I visited the restaurant last week, I work in the catering industry and have a good eye for detail. I thought my experience at Araki was slightly odd. I was greeted by a bearded tattooed waiter. My jacket was taken away but my folder with paperwork and half empty water bottle was placed on the bench behind my seat (you think they would place it out of sight). Apart from the impressive wooden table bench that you sit at the decorations (pictures etc) look on the cheap side. The sake was served in vintage French Baccarac crystal glasses, which I thought was an odd addition, why not Japanese? I noticed the junior chef had not ironed his jacket.  At one stage during the courses the chef had miscounted making the sushi and forgot to make mine, he did throw something together so I didn't miss out. However, while this was going on the other chef had already started making the next course, so while I was still eating my sushi from I was given another piece of sushi, with the words, 'sorry to rush you.' At one stage one of the kitchen staff came out to put the dishes away in the cupboard, another of the kitchen staff came out to just take a general look as far as I could tell. The female waitress seemed to spend a lot of energy rushing around. We seemed to have a repeat on one of the courses (medium fat tuna).  when myself and a few others requested the extra course at the end, their seemed to be a rush to get it done as the 20.00 deadline was approaching. we were given our dessert before we had the final sushi course. At times the whole show seemed a bit all over the shop. Not the Japanese three Michelin star precision that I expected.  My bill arrived, nearly 400 GBP. I felt a bit cheated and let down. Bills paid, we were all promptly shown the door.  In my opinion, if you want a three Michelin star experience, try one of the more established restaurants in London. Araki is the new kid on the block and needs to sharpen it's game and not see itself as a license to print money. The food is very good, but at 340 GBP you would also expect it to be.

I did feel that the menu wasn’t to exciting in terms of new sushi - it just seemed to be more about the lashings of black and white truffle or Albino caviar. Every piece really was a joy to eat, with great textures and combinations of taste that were new to me.

I felt privileged to have the opportunity to enjoy a master’s work like this - at that time he was still quite new in the country, still trying out the local ingredients. But he did very well, some pieces are so well balanced that I still can remember the flavours until today. A friend of mine went back a few times later and she told me that every time she could taste the progress - yes, masters never stop progress. I am also a craft enthusiast, some ceramic, lacquer, wood and glass works are just exquisite, very special!

96	1	Wonderful Sushi shop experience in London	Reviewed January 18, 2019 	--	Date of visit:  January 2019	2	Heard the Master chef Mr Mitsuhiro Araki would be returning to Japan in March, thus rushed to make a booking before he goes. The Araki was a typical low profile prestige Japanese sushi restaurant like those in Japan. No bright neon sign whatsoever. The two hour dinner went by pleasantly. It was amazing to watch how the Master and his deputy Mr Marty Lau prepared the food. Their knife skills and hospitality were beyond description. The food material and ingredients were so fine. It upholds the fine tradition of the top notch Japanese sushi shops. IMHO, the price is not awfully expensive for such a great dining experience. Strongly suggest keen diners to pay the restaurant a visit especially while Mr Araki is still there.

97	1	Hum.... Nope. 	Reviewed January 10, 2019 	--	Date of visit:  January 2019	8	This is a difficult one. We appreciated the extraordinary level of indulgent ingredients, but we think a journey to Paris to dine in the one star Japanese there was just as good as a culinary experience and you would have a night in Paris into the bargain (see my review a few months back on that one!)  The decor is very understated, as I am sure you have read; a row of diners facing the master himself, there is also a small private dinning room that was occupied by a very loud bunch during our visit, so much so we sometimes struggled to hear the people next to us.  The ceremony of the event is very Japanese, with lots of attention to small details, some very unusual and unique ingredients, but it felt like some were more for the shear opulence and wow factor than for flavour or texture - for example a rather hefty white truffle was grated into large mountains on our plates - but the problem with grating truffle is that it looses oil in the process and results in a not a dissimilar palate sensation to eating sawdust (if you ever have, or can imagine that !)  Don’t get me wrong, the plates presented are enjoyable, but unfortunately we were discussing on the way home that the experience reinforced our resolution to stay off the Michelin track for a bit; we could best describe this as a tick in the box.  The master is returning to Japan in a few weeks, so Araki will be handed over to his apprentice, but, irrespective of that, for us, we just would not recommend unless you are really curious about the flavour of albino caviar.

98	1	Herausragend	Reviewed December 10, 2018 	--	Date of visit:  November 2018	0	"Viele Menschen essen regelmäßig ""Sushi""...zumindest das, was man ihnen als ""Sushi"" verkauft. Geschmacksneutralen Reis, kalter, wässriger Fisch und am liebsten noch zu irgendwelchen ""kreativen"" Röllchen zusammengebastelt. Da muss man schon von Glück reden, wenn man irgendwann einmal auf ein Restaurant stößt, in dem man Sushi von zumindest so guter Qualität stößt, dass das Potenzial dieser faszinierenden Kleinigkeit für einen kurzen Augenblick sichtbar wird. Alle Berichte und Erzählungen, wie großartig wirklich gutes Sushi ist, können meiner Meinung nach nur dann im Ansatz geglaubt werden, wenn man einen solchen Moment erlebt hat, in dem man das Gefühl hat, das Potenzial zu erkennen.  Ich persönlich habe mich dann lange in Deutschland auf die Suche nach wirklich gutem Sushi gemacht. Bin quer durch die Republik gefahren und habe in allen Restaurants gegessen, die den Ruf haben, exzellent zu sein. Bei dieser Gelegenheit habe ich nur 3 Restaurants gefunden, die ""nicht schlecht"" sind...2 in Düsseldorf und eines erstaunlicherweise ganz in meiner Nähe... Dennoch konnte ich noch nicht nachvollziehen, was ich in vielen Berichten über die wirklich großen Sushimeister lesen konnte...bis jetzt! Was hier passiert, hat nichts, aber auch gar nichts mit dem zu tun, was man kennt, wenn man ""nur"" die üblichen Verdächtigen in Deutschland besucht hat. Grund dafür sind meiner Meinung nach maßgeblich 2 Dinge:  1.: Die schier unglaubliche Produktqualität. Selbst bei den herausragendsten Köchen ist es nicht selbstverständlich, diese Qualitäten zu bekommen. Was Herr Araki hier abliefert, ist absolutes Top-Niveau.  2.: Das Handwerk. Das ist sicher der entscheidende Faktor. Wenn man Herrn Araki bei seiner Arbeit beobachtet, wird überaus sichtbar wie viel Wert er auf kleinste Details legt. Es ist eine wahre Freude, seine präzisen Schnitte und routinierten Handgriffe zu sehen und zu wissen, dass hier jemand wirklich weiß, was er tut. Das Ergebnis ist atemberaubend. Jedes Sushi das der Meister zubereitet hat einen anderen, intensiven Geschmack. Feinste Nuancen werden klar herausgearbeitet und die fast schon unwirkliche Qualität des Fisches wird durch die Zubereitung noch unterstützt. Der Reis ist perfekt gesäuert und überraschend warm und locker. So locker, dass er gerade nicht in der Hand, aber im Mund dann sofort zerfällt. Die Aromen sind vielfältig. Von purem, aromatischem Thunfischbauch bis hin zu geflämmter Makrele mit starkem Grill-Aroma und perfekter Säure japanischer Zitrusfrucht bis hin zur feinen Eleganz von mildem Albino-Kaviar. Wo wir dabei sind: westliche Einflüsse und Produkte wie Kaviar, Trüffel oder verschiedene Fischsorten sind immer wieder als besondere Akzente im Menü zu erkennen, schaden dem Gesamterlebnis aber in keiner Weise. Bereits der zweite Appetizer (Tuna-Tatar mit Ei und weißem Trüffel) reichte aus, um mir sicher zu sein. Sicher, dass allein dieser Gang die Anreise nach London und den Rechnungsbetrag von immerhin fast 500£ wert waren.  Wer jetzt denkt ""Da fliegt einer nach London nur für ein Abendessen wo er für 500£ nur ein bisschen Reis und Fisch kriegt? Dafür krieg ich schon ne ganze Woche Türkei ""All Inclusive"") sollte nicht einmal darüber nachdenken, hierher zu kommen, da wünsche ich viel Spaß in der Türkei. Wer sich allerdings (so wie ich) schon lange fragt, wie viel Potenzial in dieser faszinierenden Spielart der japanischen Esskultur steckt und nicht direkt nach Tokio fliegen will, dem möchte ich dringend dazu raten, dieses Restaurant zu besuchen. In Deutschland kann man bestenfalls eine Idee davon bekommen, was hier möglicherweise auf dem Teller landen könnte...wenn man es wissen will, führt kein Weg am ""the Araki"" vorbei. Vielen Dank, Herr Araki, für das, was Sie da tun!"

101	1	Very good but not worth the money 	Reviewed October 7, 2018 	--	Date of visit:  October 2018	11	Visited on a Friday at 6pm for a birthday celebration. The food (only sushi) is of very good quality but crucially quality that can be found in quite a few other restaurants in London. Roka and dinings come to mind. Others have said that the sushi is amazing and I agree that it is very good but comparable to other places. And the quantity is very small. First each sushi is smaller than usual and there were about 10-15 overall. At £300 plus service you are looking at £30 per small bite which is extortionate by any standard. The other thing is the ‘experience’. It feels intrusive when they tell you and insist on how to eat sushi - basically getting your hand in the ‘right’ position. Another thing is the idea that women eat less - they say that unless a woman asks, her portion will be smaller. This feels wrong.  Others have commented that they were hungry and so asked for more. In our seating they asked if we were satisfied but the question was vague and essentially it becomes embarrassing to ask for more food. So no one did. Paying £1000 and ending up hungry is not nice. We had to have some more food after. Both of us felt put on the spot repeatedly which makes the experience very uncomfortable and spoiled the evening. Definitely not worth the money.

102	1	Paid over £1k and thought it’s worth it	Reviewed September 29, 2018 	--	Date of visit:  September 2018	1	Took my partner here for his birthday, after his brain haemorrhage, in lieu of the traditional weekend trip away as we didn’t know if he could fly. It’s 300£ each for the basics then you have add ons for drinks and the extra sushi-stravaganza cone at the end. Money well spent.  For people concerned about the price: it’s actually cheaper than a short weekend trip away somewhere nearby after you add in moderate to low range air or train tix, accommodation, food, local transportation and entertainment for two, and you get a truly memorable and exclusive experience for it.

104	1	A great Europeanized Japanese restaurant!	Reviewed September 20, 2018 	--	Date of visit:  September 2018	1	I decided to visit this place for two reasons: I love sushi and I was curious how a restaurant with ten seats could get three Michelin Stars! The food is amazing. It is the best Sushi I have had. I should say that it is not traditional Japanese food as the chef uses white truffle, caviar and Europe ingredients. The flavours are mostly for the Western taste. So, if you go there thinking you would get what you get in a similar place in Tokyo, you would be disappointed. However, if you go there with the expectation that you will get great food, you will come out happy. I was sitting next to someone from Japan, and he thought the food was excellent. They also give you enough food so you will not leave the place hungry. Also, everyone faces the chef so you will see the chef and sous chefs making the food and it is very interactive. I was solo but the set up is that you end up talking to others at the restaurant. I highly recommend it.

105	1	Spiritual trip!	Reviewed August 9, 2018 	--	Date of visit:  August 2018	4	The Araki (located on new Burlington street) is a sushi restaurant run by Japanese chef Mitsuhiro Araki awarded three Michelin stars. Located in Burlington Street with a very small seating capacity of nine seats at the dining counter. This restaurant specializes in the simplest form of Edomaesushi (ingredients are mixed and blended to create new flavors in fusion style sushi) , served in the traditional “sado” way (tea ceremony) with a 300£ set menu (adjustable based on allergies of the clients). The menu is composed of various types of sushi’s (around 12 dishes), menu tends to lean on tuna but you will also find a langoustine sushi (from Scotland) and salt marinated salmon sushi. Some of them are topped with Umbria truffles, black caviar and albinos caviar (from the albino sturgeon), quite unexpected. Ingredients used are fresh (main focus is on local fish) and top class and the texture of the sushi’s was just perfect. All of the dishes are just an explosion of flavors, which is very hard to explain. Team serving in the dining area was discreet but always there when needed and very professional. Few negative points are their wine list, which is small, the portions might be a little small and the 25£ they charge you to have an extra dish. Overall The Araki is not just great pleasure for your palate, but also a spirituality trip it is just not a dinner but an experience. I couldn’t compare it to any other meal I have ever had until today, probably the best meal worth any single pounds. I will certainly come back. You will have to book a seat in advance to eat here.

106	1	WOW, WOW, WOW!!!!!!	Reviewed July 16, 2018 	--	Date of visit:  July 2018	2	Well, what can I say? Simply outstanding - visitied this past weekend with my wife and two friends for a birthday - we were a little apprehensive about spending so much money but the staff were attentive (a little too much perhaps which may explain the rather large drinks bill..) and the chefs and master were friendly and very engaging - what an experience to learn about the ART of sushi, how it's meant to be served, eaten, prepared etc.  If you're after dinner and a show and have the opportunity to, please do not let this one go, you will not be dissapointed. Also nice to get some one on one time with the Master when leaving the restuarant, he personally opens the door for you, spends some time talking to you about the experience.  We're already planning our return, however may not be for a whilte as will have to save up for some time. Bill in total per couple was £1100 - for this experience....absolutely, 110% totally worth it and I have to say, it was an absolute honour to have experienced.

109	1	An experience which is too pricey	Reviewed June 14, 2018 	--	Date of visit:  September 2017	11	When we first entered the place, it was a nice cozy setup for a grand performance from Far East Sushi Master. Unfortunately it did not quite live up to the three michelin star grade. The food was spot on and I definitely will not fault on their quality and the depth of preparation. From the start to end, we did enjoy it.  However, what fell short out of our expectation was the attitude of the staff as well as the master. I find the staff very intense and their lack of friendly interaction put me off a little bit. Whenever we visit a proper sushi restaurant, the experience is all about the interaction between the chef and the customer other than the food.  This place lacks it for sure. Also I find the master to be very arrogant and inconsiderate of the customers dining at the place. We did not pay that huge sum of money to observe staff being told off during the session.  Certainly Michelin should grade this place not just based on its choice of ingredients. Overall it's overrated and I will not go back to get ripped off again.

110	1	Left unsatisfied	Reviewed June 3, 2018 	--	Date of visit:  June 2018	5	The Araki was probably the closest thing you find to a Tokyo dining experience in the UK. While the food was of a very good standard I can’t help feel it would be nice to focus a little less on truffle and caviar and a little more on rare fish. While the food side was beautifully executed and the team of chefs were on top of the meal service, the beverage side was a total let down. To start off with, they forgot our first drink order, then they had a persistant inability to serve our sake cold. Also when asked which of the sake’s was the dryest we got a puzzled look back. Couple that with a beverage service that was truly energetic. The result was just a bit of a frustrating experience. They really need a punchy sommelier to motivate the two waiters doing the beverages.  Price wise, we came fully knowing what it would be around £500 per person but if you have traveled to Tokyo you can’t help but leave thinking you didn’t get your money’s worth. It was the first time I left a 3 star Japanese restaurant hungry. Now that they got that 3rd star, they need to double down on keeping the standard up. Last night the inspectors would not have been impressed.

113	1	Perfection in motion	Reviewed May 4, 2018 	--	Date of visit:  May 2018	1	I had invited my best friend for his 60th birthday. Expectations were high. Reality was ways higher. But lets start from the beginning. We both thought of taking part in a very special event. Not just the food should be excellent. The setting and the experience were expected to be of a very special kind. Having previous experience with Japan, its culture and the way guests are treated made the expectation part of the experience. We weren't disappointed. Except for some very loud guests, who apparently didn't get it: entering The Araki is like entering a temple. Just let your spirit flow with the motions, with the peace and quiet the team is preparing your food. The movements have their deep meanings and own perfection. The famous sentence eating with your eyes is here truly of the essence. Being at The Araki is taking part to an act of not just great pleasure, but also spirituality. We enjoyed every minute of the almost two hours stay at The Araki. The sushi was the best we ever had. The same peace and harmony the food was prepared with stayed in our body. An amazing and deep feeling. The team was not just on its best behavior, discreet but always there when needed. Mitsuhiro Araki has taken us to a place we have never been before. We will never forget this evening and the touching good bye.

115	1	Not just a restaurant	Reviewed April 8, 2018 	--	Date of visit:  April 2018	2	My husband took me to The Araki as a special treat for my birthday. I wasn't sure what to expect because of the vastly contrasting reviews, but OMG I was totally blown away by the experience! Having been there, I can now understand why some people think it's a rip-off. If you go there just to fill your tummy, you may be disappointed. Although we didn't feel hungry afterwards, we didn't come out bursting at the seems. But that was not the point. The experience of eating at The Araki was more like attending a tea ceremony. We ordered 4 different kinds of sake (rice wine), and each was served in a carafe and matching cups of different and exquisite design. Each slice of fish was carefully examined by the master. Each ingredient was painstakingly prepared in front of us. It was like watching a rehearsal of a great performance (which is often more interesting than watching the performance itself). For this reason, it's best to arrive a little early and take the seats in the middle of the counter. Before we went there, I said jokingly that my husband could have bought the best seats at the opera for the same price. At the end of our meal, we came out feeling as if we did go and see a great opera!

118	1	Don't waste your time and money here	Reviewed February 9, 2018 	--	Date of visit:  February 2018	22	First of all, it is not an authentic japanese experience. It is a bit more fusion than japanese. Secondly, the portions are ridiculously small. Most of what is served is sushi, (just fish on rice with the occasional fancy topping like truffle), and it is not a standard size. You can easily tell that they are trying to increase their profit margins. Now, if they were using japanese ingredients, maybe i'd understand but not one piece of fish or seafood was from japan. The only japanese thing they had was the fresh wasabi which mind you they are too cheap to put in front of you and instead grate a small portion on the sushi. To show how cheap they are, they didn't even bother serving one piece of wagyu. To top it off you get a bill for 1000 pounds (2 people) if you dared order one of the overpriced sake bottles and when you leave you are not full.  About 1 hour later we went for kebabs. Terribly overhyped and overpriced.
