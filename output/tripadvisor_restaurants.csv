The array of dishes include many Heston Blumenthal classics, alongside some new creations – and his motto, 'question everything', remains. The multi-sensory cooking is testament to his ground-breaking approach: innovative, playful and perfectly judged, with harmonious textures and flavours. Theatrical, interactive service from the engaging team heightens the experience.	3	50
